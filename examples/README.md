Kaldi binaries re-implemented using PyKaldi
-------------------------------------------
This folder contains some example Python scripts using PyKaldi. These scripts
take the same inputs, arguments and produce the same outputs as their Kaldi
counterparts.

* copy-matrix.py: Copy matrices, or archives of matrices (e.g. features or transforms)

* compute-mfcc-feats.py: Create MFCC feature files.

* compute-cmvn-stats-two-channel.py: Compute cepstral mean and variance normalization statistics.

* extract-segments.py: Extract segments from a large audio file in WAV format.

* gmm-decode-faster.py: Decode features using GMM-based model.
